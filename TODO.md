# TODO 

Basic exploration of using existing tools (e.g. VSCode) and popular publishing destinations (e.g. Medium and Hashnode) to establish workflow, and then design a web application workflow and UI to suit the staging and execution of content strategy campaigns.

- ~~Pushing a blog post from localhost to Medium via the Medium API~~
- Pushing a blog post from localhost to Hashnode via the Hashnode API
- Creating a basic web application to push Medium APIs
- Create basic UI for web application
- Add other endpoints (e.g. Hashnode) to the web application
- Explore GitHub actions in the workflow

The other half of the exploration is how to source and combine the post statistics from multiple published instances. This is useful when cross-posting, or posting different versions of content for different audiences, but being relative to a campaign or topic. To keep it simple I'm focusing on:

- Retreiving post statistics from the Medium API
- Retreiving post statistics from the Hashnode API
- Using non-AI tools where required (PhantomBuster or scraping)
- UI for managing content and content campaigns across multiple endpoints
